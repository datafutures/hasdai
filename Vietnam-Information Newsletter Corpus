Vietnam-Information Newsletter Corpus

The Vietnam-Information newsletters were a series of publications directed at the international community made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from the 1940s to the mid 1950s. The rare english-language booklets are each around 10 pages long and the Institute of East Asian Studies at ENS-Lyon (IAO) has the largest surviving collection, though the originals are now very fragile. Maison des Sciences de l'Homme support has enabled hi-resolution digitization of the originals, delivered here as an Invenio repository and IIIF service employing annotation conducted in a collaboration with Hesburgh Libraries, Notre Dame, Indiana.
